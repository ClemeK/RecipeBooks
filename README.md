# RecipeBooks

I was watching a You-Tuber who collects old recipe book’s and he was saying how he has hundreds of books in multiply locations.

This also causes a problem when researching the origins of a particular recipe, through the many cookery books.
So, I created this program to try an assist in that process. I started off with by creating a small database program to store just the books and their recipe titles, I then got carried away and added in the ability to add the whole recipe if you wish.

## Installation
There is no installation program, you just need to download the zip file and unpack it into a directory.

## To Run the Application
Locate the RecipeBooks.exe in the directory and double click.
